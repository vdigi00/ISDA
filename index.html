     <p> Target audience: U.S. telecommunication companies
         Need satellites protected, Launch paths cleared of debris, ISS protected </p>
        
        <p> Ethical tactics>

        <ol>Use proven data and statistics to sell services</ol>
        <ol>Over achieve promised services</ol>
<ol>Avoid workplace accidents and deaths while providing due compensation</ol> 
<ol>Be open and transparent to clients and the public</ol>
<ol>Record and document successes and failures</ol>
<ol>Provide testimony from certified experts encouraging our services (merchants of doubt)</ol>
<ol>Rocket scientists, engineers, astronauts</ol>
            <ol>Stress the importance of the dangers of unprotected and cluttered space </ol>
        
        <p> Unethical tactics </p>
        
        <ol> Spreading fear and panic throughout the public and scare them into wanting space security</ol>
<ol>Sample with bias (chapter 1 how to lie with statistics)</ol>
<ol>Make debris more impactful and up lay the dangers of the incoming meteorites and space debris</ol>
<ol>Correlation equals causation (post hoc rides again chp how to lie with statistics)</ol>
     <ul>More spacecraft = more debris, more debris = more damage, more damage = more jobs for us = more money = more spacecraftâ€¦</ul>
     <ul>How audience will respond</ul>
        
        <ol>Scared and panicked
Put pressure on their national government and their space agencies to work on these issues with our company</ol>
        
        <ol>Sabotage</ol>
        
        <ul>Interfere with the launch paths of different companies and prevent their launches</ul>
<ul>Delay launch schedules by claim ung it is unsafe to launch something with so much debris into space</ul> 
<ul>Put into space more debris so that there will be more to clean up for future missions</ul>
<ul>Pay off space agencies and countries to send into space faulty vehicles that create more space trash</ul>
        
        <ol>Discrediting scientists that disagree with company projects or scientific findings (Merchants of Doubt)</ol>
<ol>Openly spreading bad science that would bolster the reputation of our company and get rid of any doubters</ol>
<ol>Allowing certain debris to fall back to Earth or damage space technology to prove the necessity of our services and protection</ol> 

<p>For every rocket that is launched some part of the rocket is discarded, seconds stages, fairing, boosters
    Out of service satellites. </p>
