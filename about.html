            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Over the last 50 years and hundreds of rocket launches, satellites and rocket bodies have littered Earthâ€™s orbit. NASA currently tracks over 6,000 tons of debris in Low Earth Orbit. Each piece can be moving at speeds of up to 17,500 miles per hour. Launch windows narrow and satellites become damaged.  The ISS has been hit by space debris before and punctured. </p>
            <p>With an influx of rocket launches, space debris is filling earth's orbit.  This space debris has the speed to damage satellites and even destroy them.  According to NASA, there are more than 27,000 softball size pieces of orbital debris or larger. NASA also states there is much more debris that can cause damage but is too small to track.</p> 
            <p>This space debris is very dangerous to Astronauts conducting spacewalks as well as robotic missions.  Currently, rocket launches need to be aware of space debris and conditions in space. Launch windows are calculated to avoid large groups of debris.</p>
            <p>The International Space Defense Agency (ISDA) will open larger launch windows and protect vehicles and satellites in orbit.
            <p>There is no room for error, therefore the ISDA will conduct effective and safe missions to establish our orbit as a more safe and exceptional field for research and advancements for the betterment of human civilization.</p>
            <p>
                ISDA will solve these problems with 3 main tactics:
                <ul>
                    <li>A spacecraft will go into orbit and push the debris out of Earth's orbit.</li>
                    <li>A spacecraft will break the debris into smaller pieces to burn in Earth's atmosphere</li>
                    <li>A spacecraft will push the debris into Earth's atmosphere to burn the debris</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
